## Questions & Contact

### Common Questions

**Q: Can we change the colors later?**
A: Yes, but it's not recommended after launch. Color changes require updating all assets. Best to finalize now.

**Q: Can we use just the shield icon without mountains?**
A: Not recommended. The mountains are integral to the "Arctic Guardian" identity. Use the full icon or horizontal lockup.

**Q: What if we need it in different colors for partners?**
A: Use monochrome versions. We can create partner co-branding guidelines that allow their colors alongside our logo in monochrome.

**Q: How do we make changes to the SVG?**
A: SVG files can be edited in Adobe Illustrator, Figma, or even code editors. However, use approved files to maintain consistency.

**Q: Can this be animated?**
A: Yes! SVG is animation-friendly. We can create subtle animations (aurora glow, pulse effect) for web use.
